### Description
This is a group project I have participated in as a Scrum Master and a developer. The goal of the project was to create a website for a fictional ice-cream store. 

### My contribution
I was responsible for: 
- creating & updating our Trello, running daily stand-ups, organising the workflow as a Scrum Master;
- creating the header (HTML, CSS, animations, modal window) as a developer.
